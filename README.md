# CopyNumberCellShift
Copy Number Cell Shift
This project aims to detect the change points in copy number variation from DNA sequencing data of cancer cells as well as normal cells. Adopting the framework from a previous similar work, we add a cell-specific shift to adjust the cell-specific effects and apply a new tuning procedure to improve the selection procedure.
